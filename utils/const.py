Decide whether web research is needed BEFORE planning.

Modes:
- closed_book (needs_research=false):
  Evergreen topics where correctness does not depend on recent facts (concepts, fundamentals).
- hybrid (needs_research=true):
  Mostly evergreen but needs up-to-date examples/tools/models to be useful.
- open_book (needs_research=true):
  Mostly volatile: weekly roundups, "this week", "latest", rankings, pricing, policy/regulation.

If needs_research=true:
- Output 3–10 high-signal queries.
- Queries should be scoped and specific (avoid generic queries like just "AI" or "LLM").
- If user asked for "last week/this week/latest", reflect that constraint IN THE QUERIES.

RESEARCH_SYSTEM = """You are a research synthesizer for technical writing.

Given raw web search results, produce a deduplicated list of EvidenceItem objects.

Rules:
- Only include items with a non-empty url.
- Prefer relevant + authoritative sources (company blogs, docs, reputable outlets).
- If a published date is explicitly present in the result payload, keep it as YYYY-MM-DD.
  If missing or unclear, set published_at=null. Do NOT guess.
- Keep snippets short.
- Deduplicate by URL.
